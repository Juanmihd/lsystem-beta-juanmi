===============

Project for the Msc in Computer Games & Entertainment
This project is done for the module of Mathematics and Visual Effects.

The assignment was proposed as a creation of 2D L-systems. There was the possibility to add some extra features, as 3D, context-dependant L-systems...
I opted to aim straight away to the most complex situation.

Therefore, this project of L-Systems aims to be able to generate 3D L-systems that can be stochastic, context-dependant, 3D, with leafs...

It was ment not to be realistic simulation of trees but a first approach of a L-System able to generate different kind of trees.
